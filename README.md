# SoundID
I created and trained a neural network to take sound samples and classify them. I created 2 python files one builds and trains the network and the other runs the AI to see how it classifies sounds. The first file is SoundID.py and works perfectly and saved the AI in 2 formats (sound_identifier.h5 and the sound_identifier folder). However, this file will not work again because I completely ran out of space on my computer and had to delete the training set so my computer could work properly. The other file is ai_id.py and I never finished it because my original goal was to use a live microphone feed but then I remembered how Tate ruined his webcam by doing something similar and I didnâ€™t want to risk doing the same when I absolutely need my microphone to work for video calls. Right now it is incomplete code that could eventually take a .wav file and use the AI to identify the sound in the file.
